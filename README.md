# Ad Click Prediction Machine Learning Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Ad Click Prediction Machine Learning Project! The objective of this project is to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement or not. We have a dataset containing the following features:

- Daily Time Spent on Site
- Age
- Area Income
- Daily Internet Usage
- Ad Topic Line
- City
- Male (Binary: 1 for Male, 0 for Female)
- Country
- Timestamp (Date and Time of the user interaction)
- Clicked on Ad (Target Variable: 0 for No click, 1 for Clicked)

## Models Implemented
We have used various machine learning models to tackle the ad click prediction task. The models applied are:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Voting Classifier
- Random Forest
- XGBoost Classifier
